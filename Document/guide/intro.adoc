== Introduction

This document describes the automated functional and performance tests that you can
run to validate that an S3 provider is compatible with the IBM Software cloud offload functionality.

=== Advantages

* quick check for the compatibility between the s3 provider and the IBM
Software cloud offload functionality

* performance overview

* scalability potential

=== Overview

* Running these tests will verify that you can perform offload and restore from the S3
provider using the IBM Software cloud offload functionality. There tests will allow you to measure
the throughput for a single offload and restore. You can also analyse how the software handles scaling.
