== Prerequisites

* The test scripts will be run locally on a vSnap. To deploy and initialize a vSnap use the following link:



** Install vSnap: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSNQFQ_10.1.5/spp/t_spp_install_vsnap.html[install]



** Initialize vSnap: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSNQFQ_10.1.5/spp/t_spp_config_vsnap_initialize.html[initialize]



** Expand vSnap pool (if needed): https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSNQFQ_10.1.5/spp/t_spp_expand_storage_pool.html[expand_pool]

* Install git on the vSnap to clone the s3validator repo. Running the following commands on the vSnap will give you access to
the test scripts locally on your freshly deployed vSnap.

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install git

$ git clone https://github.com/sppautomation/s3validator.git
----


* install environment to run the scripts.
**  Run the script "install.sh" that is in the s3validator directory.
** This will set up a Python virtual environment and will install some
dependencies that are necessary to run tests. Note that packages will
be installed into the newly created virtual environment so no changes
will be made to host's software.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./install.sh
